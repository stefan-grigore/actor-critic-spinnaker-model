Description:

        lazyarray is a Python package that provides a lazily-evaluated numerical array
        class, ``larray``, based on and compatible with NumPy arrays.
        
        Lazy evaluation means that any operations on the array (potentially including
        array construction) are not performed immediately, but are delayed until
        evaluation is specifically requested. Evaluation of only parts of the array is
        also possible.
        
        Use of an ``larray`` can potentially save considerable computation time
        and memory in cases where:
        
            * arrays are used conditionally (i.e. there are cases in which the array is
              never used)
            * only parts of an array are used (for example in distributed computation,
              in which each MPI node operates on a subset of the elements of the array)
