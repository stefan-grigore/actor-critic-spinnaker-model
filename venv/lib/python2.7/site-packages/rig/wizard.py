"""
Many applications require end-users to supply the details of a SpiNNaker system
they wish to connect to. This module hopes to provide a more-friendly user
interaction than just asking for an IP address in the general case.

This module contains a number of wizards which extract various pieces of
information from a user by asking simple questions. A wizard is a generator
function which generates sequences of questions to which the answers are fed
back into the generator. For command-line applications, a wrapper script
:py:func:`~rig.wizard.cli_wrapper` will do all the heavy-lifting::

    >> from rig.wizard import (
    ..     ip_address_wizard, cli_wrapper)
    >> resp = cli_wrapper(ip_address_wizard())
    Would you like to auto-detect the SpiNNaker system's IP address?
        0: Auto-detect
        1: Manually Enter IP address or hostname
    Select an option 0-1 (default: 0):

    Make sure the SpiNNaker system is switched on and is not booted.
    <Press enter to continue>

    Discovering attached SpiNNaker systems...

    >> resp
    {'ip_address': '192.168.240.253'}

Third-parties whose needs are not met by the supplied CLI wizard interface are
encouraged to build their own front-ends which support the wizard protocol. The
wizard generator functions generate the following objects:

* :py:class:`~rig.wizard.MultipleChoice` This tuple includes a question to be
  presented to the user along with a list of valid options to choose from and
  a default value to select (or None if no default exists). The generator
  should be sent the index of the user's selection.
* :py:class:`~rig.wizard.Text` This tuple includes a question to be
  presented to the user.  The generator should be sent the user's free-form
  text response as a string.
* :py:class:`~rig.wizard.Prompt` This tuple indicates the user should be shown
  a message which they should read and acknowledge. No response is expected.
* :py:class:`~rig.wizard.Info` This tuple indicates the user should be shown
  a message to which no response is required.

When the information has been collected successfully,
:py:exc:`~rig.wizard.Success` is raised by the wizard with a `data` attribute
containing a dictionary with the information gathered by the wizard. If the
wizard fails, a :py:exc:`~rig.wizard.Failure` exception is thrown with a
human-readable message.
