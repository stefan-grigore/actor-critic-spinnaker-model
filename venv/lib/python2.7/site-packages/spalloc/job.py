class Job(object):
    """A high-level interface for requesting and managing allocations of
    SpiNNaker boards.

    Constructing a :py:class:`.Job` object connects to a `spalloc-server
    <https://github.com/project-rig/spalloc_server>`_ and requests a number of
    SpiNNaker boards. See the :py:meth:`constructor <.Job.__init__>` for
    details of the types of requests which may be made. The job object may then
    be used to monitor the state of the request, control the boards allocated
    and determine their IP addresses.

    In its simplest form, a :py:class:`.Job` can be used as a context manager
    like so::

        >>> from spalloc import Job
        >>> with Job(6) as j:
        ...     my_boot(j.hostname, j.width, j.height)
        ...     my_application(j.hostname)

    In this example a six-board machine is requested and the ``with`` context
    is entered once the allocation has been made and the allocated boards are
    fully powered on. When control leaves the block, the job is destroyed and
    the boards shut down by the server ready for another job.

    For more fine-grained control, the same functionality is available via
    various methods::

        >>> from spalloc import Job
        >>> j = Job(6)
        >>> j.wait_until_ready()
        >>> my_boot(j.hostname, j.width, j.height)
        >>> my_application(j.hostname)
        >>> j.destroy()

    .. note::

        More complex applications may wish to log the following attributes of
        their job to support later debugging efforts:

        * ``job.id`` -- May be used to query the state of the job and find out
          its fate if cancelled or destroyed. The ``spalloc-job`` command can
          be used to discover the state/fate of the job and
          ``spalloc-where-is`` may be used to find out what boards problem
          chips reside on.
        * ``job.machine_name`` and ``job.boards`` together give a complete
          record of the hardware used by the job. The ``spalloc-where-is``
          command may be used to find out the physical locations of the boards
          used.

    :py:class:`.Job` objects have the following attributes which describe the
    job and its allocated machines:

    Attributes
    ----------
    job.id : int or None
        The job ID allocated by the server to the job.
    job.state : :py:class:`.JobState`
        The current state of the job.
    job.power : bool or None
        If boards have been allocated to the job, are they on (True) or off
        (False). None if no boards are allocated to the job.
    job.reason : str or None
        If the job has been destroyed, gives the reason (which may be None), or
        None if the job has not been destroyed.
    job.hostname : str or None
        The hostname of the SpiNNaker chip at (0, 0), or None if no boards have
        been allocated to the job.
    job.connections : {(x, y): hostname, ...} or None
        The hostnames of all Ethernet-connected SpiNNaker chips, or None if no
        boards have been allocated to the job.
    job.width : int or None
        The width of the SpiNNaker network in chips, or None if no boards have
        been allocated to the job.
    job.height : int or None
        The height of the SpiNNaker network in chips, or None if no boards have
        been allocated to the job.
    job.machine_name : str or None
        The name of the machine the boards are allocated in, or None if not yet
        allocated.
    job.boards : [[x, y, z], ...] or None
        The logical coordinates allocated to the job, or None if not yet
        allocated.
    """

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        """Request a SpiNNaker machine.

        A :py:class:`.Job` is constructed in one of the following styles::

            >>> # Any single (SpiNN-5) board
            >>> Job()
            >>> Job(1)

            >>> # Any machine with at least 4 boards
            >>> Job(4)

            >>> # Any 7-or-more board machine with an aspect ratio at least as
            >>> # square as 1:2
            >>> Job(7, min_ratio=0.5)

            >>> # Any 4x5 triad segment of a machine (may or may-not be a
            >>> # torus/full machine)
            >>> Job(4, 5)

            >>> # Any torus-connected (full machine) 4x2 machine
            >>> Job(4, 2, require_torus=True)

            >>> # Board x=3, y=2, z=1 on the machine named "m"
            >>> Job(3, 2, 1, machine="m")

            >>> # Keep using (and keeping-alive) an existing allocation
            >>> Job(resume_job_id=123)

        Once finished with a Job, the :py:meth:`.destroy` (or in unusual
        applications :py:meth:`.Job.close`) method must be called to destroy
        the job, close the connection to the server and terminate the
        background keep-alive thread. Alternatively, a Job may be used as a
        context manager which automatically calls :py:meth:`.destroy` on
        exiting the block::

            >>> with Job() as j:
            ...     # ...for example...
            ...     my_boot(j.hostname, j.width, j.height)
            ...     my_application(j.hostname)

        The following keyword-only parameters below are used both to specify
        the server details as well as the job requirements. Most parameters
        default to the values supplied in the local :py:mod:`~spalloc.config`
        file allowing usage as in the examples above.

        Parameters
        ----------
        hostname : str
            **Required.** The name of the spalloc server to connect to. (Read
            from config file if not specified.)
        port : int
            The port number of the spalloc server to connect to. (Read from
            config file if not specified.)
        reconnect_delay : float
            Number of seconds between attempts to reconnect to the server.
            (Read from config file if not specified.)
        timeout : float or None
            Timeout for waiting for replies from the server. If None, will keep
            trying forever. (Read from config file if not specified.)
        config_filenames : [str, ...]
            If given must be a list of filenames to read configuration options
            from. If not supplied, the default config file locations are
            searched. Set to an empty list to prevent using values from config
            files.

        Other Parameters
        ----------------
        resume_job_id : int or None
            If supplied, rather than creating a new job, take on an existing
            one, keeping it alive as required by the original job. If this
            argument is used, all other requirements are ignored.
        owner : str
            **Required.** The name of the owner of the job. By convention this
            should be your email address. (Read from config file if not
            specified.)
        keepalive : float or None
            The number of seconds after which the server may consider the job
            dead if this client cannot communicate with it. If None, no timeout
            will be used and the job will run until explicitly destroyed. Use
            with extreme caution. (Read from config file if not specified.)
        machine : str or None
            Specify the name of a machine which this job must be executed on.
            If None, the first suitable machine available will be used,
            according to the tags selected below. Must be None when tags are
            given. (Read from config file if not specified.)
        tags : [str, ...] or None
            The set of tags which any machine running this job must have. If
            None is supplied, only machines with the "default" tag will be
            used. If machine is given, this argument must be None.  (Read from
            config file if not specified.)
        min_ratio : float
            The aspect ratio (h/w) which the allocated region must be 'at least
            as square as'. Set to 0.0 for any allowable shape, 1.0 to be
            exactly square etc. Ignored when allocating single boards or
            specific rectangles of triads.
        max_dead_boards : int or None
            The maximum number of broken or unreachable boards to allow in the
            allocated region. If None, any number of dead boards is permitted,
            as long as the board on the bottom-left corner is alive. (Read from
            config file if not specified.)
        max_dead_links : int or None
            The maximum number of broken links allow in the allocated region.
            When require_torus is True this includes wrap-around links,
            otherwise peripheral links are not counted.  If None, any number of
            broken links is allowed. (Read from config file if not specified.).
        require_torus : bool
            If True, only allocate blocks with torus connectivity. In general
            this will only succeed for requests to allocate an entire machine.
            Must be False when allocating boards. (Read from config file if not
            specified.)
